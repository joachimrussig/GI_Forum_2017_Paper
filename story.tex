\section{Story}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Motivation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item heat is critical for humans
		\item particular problems for risk groups (illness, old, etc)
		\item walking to areas often done action in particular to typical locations (shopping, health care, etc)
		\item those actions have to be done   
	\end{itemize}
	\item Problem definition
	\begin{itemize}
		\item how to minimize the impact of heat stress on walking paths?
		\item subdivided into:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item for a given route?
			\item When and how to walk typical routes, e.g. pharmacy, doctor
		\end{itemize} 
	\end{itemize}
	\item method:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Goal of this paper: We want to provide a routing method to minimize the heat stress of typical walking actions
		\item We do so by providing a value function for heat stress which can be used in route planning
	\end{itemize}
	\item Evaluation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our data set
		\item Evaluation 1 on routes given date in time.  (pure routing approach) and its metrics
		\item Evaluation 2: producing queries for typical walking tasks (our selection) and their evaluation
		\item implementation as a demonstrator is produced and available at $homepage$
	\end{itemize}
	\item Conclusion and contribution
\end{itemize}
