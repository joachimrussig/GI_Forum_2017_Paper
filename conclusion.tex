\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item main insights:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item both routing and finding the optimal time can reduce heat exposure significantly
			\item the proposed approaches can help people ot adapt their everyday behaviour  to reduce their heat stress risk
		\end{itemize}
	\item non restrictions of our approach / possible improvements
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the data basis can be improved (e.g. via a locale sensor network)
			\item using a dynamic instead of static routing approach
			\item find a optimal tour for multiple shops 
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
